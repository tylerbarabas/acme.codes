    <h2 style="color: #f05f40">V. Special Promotions and Purchases; Submission of Content to be Published.</h2>
</p>
<p>
    To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and surveys ("Special Promotions"), or to make online purchases or subscriptions (such
    purchases or subscriptions herein referred to as "Purchases"), You may need to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail
    address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information may be collected by COMPANY or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor involved in,
    or providing services in connection with, a Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.
</p>
<p>
    If You make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion on one of our sites or through our Services, COMPANY will collect Your personally
    identifiable information, and You are deemed to consent to us providing Your information to third parties who provide certain services such as processing
    of credit card transactions, customer service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as applicable. (As more
    fully described below in <a style="color: #f05f40" href="/#!/privacy-policy#UDSI">Section XII</a>, these third parties are generally prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise
    distributing any personal data of our customers, unless You choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their
    respective privacy policies.). Also, by entering a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, You are agreeing to the official rules that govern that
    sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, which may contain specific provisions applicable to You, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the
    sponsor(s) of the promotion to use Your name, voice or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.
</p>
<p>
    If You make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which COMPANY is participating on a third party's website (or through some other
    means or medium), we will collect Your information from the third party only if You opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required
    to fulfill some function in relation to Your activity (e.g., to send Your order or deliver a prize).
</p>
<p>
    If You submit to the Website a comment, photograph or other content to be published, online or offline (including on-air, in a DVD, or any other format),
    we may publish Your name or other personally identifiable information in connection with publishing the content and You are hereby deemed to give us
    permission to do such.

<p>
    <a id="ICBOMM"><br><br><br><br></a>
    <h2 style="color: #f05f40">VI. Information Collected by Other Means or Media.</h2>
</p>
<p>
    In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and other information about You through other means, directly or indirectly.
    For example, if You access any COMPANY content, or purchase such content via Your wireless carrier or through another third party, COMPANY may collect
    information directly from You or through the third party. Likewise, if You use our software, or provide information to other companies who share
    information about their customers, we may collect additional information about You. In each of these cases, COMPANY will apply this Privacy Policy to any
    personally identifiable information.

<p>
    <a id="IAOP"><br><br><br><br></a>
    <h2 style="color: #f05f40">VII. Information About Other People.</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Some COMPANY Websites and Services may ask You to submit personally identifiable, as well as other information about other people and/or their affiliated
    companies. For example, in creating a Code Creation Account, a User will have to supply information about their customer.
</p>
<p>
    Such information may be used to facilitate transactions among Users, COMPANY, and third parties. As such, such information may be shared and used by all
    such parties to the extent COMPANY desires or otherwise allows such information to be shared. You are hereby accepting and agreeing to such use and sharing
    of information.

    with customer service, You do so with the understanding that an operator may view and make changes to the information in Your User Account in order to
    provide the assistance that You need.

    be asked to provide information concerning Your personal preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. This information is generally optional but may be
    included in Your User Account profile. COMPANY requests this information to understand You better and to also bring to Your attention new services,
    programs, or offers that may be of interest to You.

<p>
    COMPANY's web pages may include advertisements for third parties and their products, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web
    beacon served by the third party. COMPANY does not control cookies in such third party ads, and visitors are encouraged to check the privacy policies of
    advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. COMPANY's Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information
    collected from You by third party ad servers. These companies may use information (not including Your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number)
    about Your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of
    interest to You.

<p>
    A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web
    page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is
    sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as
    part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. COMPANY may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the
    Website or to monitor how our users navigate the Website, and COMPANY may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent
    were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.

    spent, type of product, general addresses to be shipped to etc), retailer information related to purchases (i.e. type of retailer and their buying habits)
    and brand information (i.e. type of product a Brand showcases).

</p>
<p>
    While COMPANY takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect Your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure and to prevent
    possible security breaches in our Websites, Services, and customer databases, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is
    completely secure. Consequently, COMPANY cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. COMPANY cannot
    guarantee to Buyers that User Accounts are properly affiliated by Brand Users. Your use of COMPANY Websites and Services is at Your own risk. COMPANY urges
    You to take steps to determine what information You will submit to the Website, keep Your information safe by memorizing Your password or keeping it in a
    safe place (separate from Your account information), logging out of Your User Account, and closing Your Web browser.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever You give COMPANY sensitive or confidential information (for example, credit card numbers for Purchases), COMPANY will take commercially reasonable
    steps to protect the transmission of such information by establishing a secure connection with Your Web browser. COMPANY employs a security technology
    known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of payment information to the site. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Website
    where You make a Purchase, credit and debit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.
