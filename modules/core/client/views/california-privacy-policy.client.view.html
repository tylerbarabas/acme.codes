    <p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or
    household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third
    parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a
    request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the
    preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
    <br>
    However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy
    policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first
    affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by
    notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
    <br>
        
    As stated in our <a style="color: #f05f40" href="/#!/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing      
    purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by
    opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to
    share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do
    not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third
    party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive
    future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want
    that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information.
    You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
    <br>
    California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a style="color: #f05f40" href="mailto:california-privacy@acme.codes">california-privacy@acme.codes</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means
    other than through this e-mail address.
